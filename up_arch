 Up is a tool that automates the update procedure for Arch based
 Linux systems.

 Commands:
    up = full system update.

    Running "up" with no options will update the apt cache and then perform a
    full distribution update automatically.

    up --clean = full system update with cleanup.

    Adding the "--clean" option will invoke the apt commands to search for and
    remove locally cached packages that are no longer in the repositories and
    remove orphaned packages that are no longer needed by programs.

    up --help = shows this help page.
